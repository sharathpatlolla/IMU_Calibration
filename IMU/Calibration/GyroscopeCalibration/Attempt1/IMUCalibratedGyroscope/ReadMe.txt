Before you run the "IMUCalibratedGyroscope" file go to "IMUGyroscopeCalibration_Step1" and follow the instructions. 

This arduino code gives you the calibrated gyroscope values. To plot the uncalibrated vs calibrated values, 
->run this arduino code
->Close the serial monitor and run the "Graphs_Acceleration2_2_NormalVsCalibrated_IMU.m" in MATLAB
