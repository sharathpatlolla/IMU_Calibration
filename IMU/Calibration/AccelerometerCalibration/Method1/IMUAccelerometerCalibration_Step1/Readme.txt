This arduino code will help you in positioning the imu in correct position (where the acceleration components are each  1/sqrt(3) or -1/sqrt(3) in the units of g 
the tolerence used is 0.02

When the position is almost correct you can see "THIS IS THE REQUIRED ANGLE" in the serial monitor, Once you see "THIS IS THE REQUIRED ANGLE" run "IMUAccelerometerCalibration_Step2" holding the position constant.

NOTE: It is better if you use some kind of holder to hold the IMU in the required position
