The order to execute the files is 

IMUAccelerometerCalibration_Step1 -> This code helps you in setting the IMU in +60 and -60 Degrees in X,Y,Z axes. Run the code and adjust the orientation, Once the IMU is in required orientation you can see "THIS IS THE REQUIRED ANGLE" in  serial monitor.
IMUAccelerometerCalibration_Step2 -> This code outputs the values which are the input for the MATLAB code.
IMUCalibratedAccelerometer	  -> This code outputs the calibrated acceleration values.
