Before you run the "IMUCalibratedAccelerometer2" file go to "IMUAccelerometerCalibration2_Step2" and follow the instructions. 

This arduino code gives you the calibrated acceleration values. To plot the uncalibrated vs calibrated values, 
->run this arduino code
->Close the serial monitor and run the "Graphs_Acceleration2_NormalVsCalibrated_IMU.m" in MATLAB

"There is readme file in every folder and sub folder. Please go through them step by step to save time and make any edits you feel neccessary. If this is the first ReadMe file you are reading for this calibration, please go back a folder
and read the ReadMe file in that folder"
