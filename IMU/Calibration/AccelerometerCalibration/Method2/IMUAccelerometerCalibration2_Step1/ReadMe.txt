This code compares the acceleration values as reference and tells you the orientation of the IMU with respect to gravity. If the IMU is along -60/+60 degrees along X,Y,Z, the serial monitor outputs "IMU is along (1,1,1) or (-1,-1,-1)".
It is suggested to fix the IMU in +60 or -60 degrees in X,Y,Z using this code and then run the "IMUAccelerometerCalibration2_Step2" in arduino IDE.
