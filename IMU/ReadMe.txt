
I2C communication is used. If you don't know about I2C communication, Read about the difference between I2C and serial communication.

Instruction to interface IMU:

4 pins are enough
SCL- Connect to the clock line of the micro controller board,
SDA- Connect to the Data line of the micro controller
GND- Connect to ground
VCC- Connect to power

Pin numbers for clock and data lines are different for different controllers, look up the datasheet/pinout types to find the pin numbers

Calibration-> To calibrate the IMU, refer to this folder

"There are ReadMe.txt files in most of the folders, please go through them before starting to work with the code and make any edits you feel neccessary, it's time efficient!"
